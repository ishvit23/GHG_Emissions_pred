# GHG Emission Analysis

This project analyzes Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using supply chain emission factors for US industries and commodities.

## Project Structure
- `GHG_emission/GHG emission.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- `GHG_emission/SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx`: Dataset containing supply chain emission factors.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `GHG_emission/GHG emission.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- jupyter

Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

## Usage
